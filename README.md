# Code Refactor Starter Code
USER STORY
As a Marketing Strategy, I want a codebase that follows accessibility standards so that our own site is optimized for search engines

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
•	GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
•	WHEN I view the source code
•	THEN I find semantic HTML elements
•	WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
•	THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
•	WHEN I view the image elements
•	THEN I find accessible alt attributes
•	WHEN I view the heading attributes
•	THEN they fall in sequential order
•	WHEN I view the title element
•	THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

TASKS PERFORMED
•	Re-name “website” to “Horiseon Website” in HTML
•	Made “Horiseon” one color to reduce code complexity
•	Add alt “” to all images in HTML file.  Images are decorative, therefore “”.
•	Changed areas with low contrast from 16px to 20px – lead generation, brand awareness, cost management.  Updated p class in CSS.
•	Insert section explanations into HTML
•	Grouped and labeled CSS selectors

FUTURE CONSIDERATIONS
•	Create new headers for H2 and H3 so that it is very clear that one section is “services” and one section is “benefits”
